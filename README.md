# Introduction to Deep Learning - Homework

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed for the first homework assignment in the "Introduction to Deep Learning" course. The goal of this homework is to:

- Set up and become familiar with Google Colab.
- Work with Jupyter notebooks and understand their functionality.
- Actively read and analyze the code examples in Chapter 4 of the course textbook.
- Learn how to submit a notebook as a report.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to complete the homework:

### 1. Setup

1. **Download Notebooks:**
   - Download the necessary notebooks from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks).
   - A notebook with additional text and comments is also available on Blackboard.

2. **Google Colab Setup:**
   - Login to Google Colab using your Google student account at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

3. **Install Packages:**
   - In Google Colab, you might need to install some packages. This may not be necessary if packages are already available. Check the notebook instructions for package installations.

### 2. Working with Notebooks

#### Section 4.1

- **Error Handling:**
  - If you encounter any errors, try to resolve them independently.
  - Ignore ‘deprecation’ warnings as they are familiar and generally not problematic for short-term usage.

- **Experiments:**
  - Conduct experiments as outlined in section 4.1.6 of the textbook.
  - Test with 32 and 64 units; do not test additional units. Adjust the number of layers based on the results from your initial experiment.
  - Structure your experiments and document your results using ‘text’ blocks in the notebook.

- **Save Your Work:**
  - Save the notebook after completing your experiments.

#### Section 4.2

- **Code Understanding:**
  - You do not need to fully understand the code for transforming vector representations back to sentences (see Listing 4.12 in the textbook).

- **Performance Reporting:**
  - Write a ‘code’ block to output the test performance of the model with an information bottleneck.

- **Experiments:**
  - Perform the suggested experiments. Test with 32 and 128 units, and adjust the number of layers based on the optimal architecture.
  - Document your results in the notebook using ‘text’ blocks.

- **Save Your Work:**
  - Save the notebook after completing your experiments.

#### Section 4.3

- **Running Code:**
  - Execute the provided code and read the accompanying text.

- **Analysis:**
  - Perform the analysis with 2-fold cross-validation. Provide a brief discussion of your results.

- **Save Your Work:**
  - Save the notebook after completing your analysis.

## Submission

- Ensure that all notebooks are well-documented and saved.
- Submit the completed notebooks according to the course's submission guidelines.

## Additional Information

- **Notebook Files:**
  - Notebooks are provided in `.ipynb` format and can be opened and edited in Google Colab.

- **Help and Resources:**
  - Refer to the textbook (Chollet, F. (2023). Deep learning with Python (2nd ed.). Manning Publications.) for detailed explanations of the code and concepts.
  - Use Google Colab’s documentation and community forums for technical support.
